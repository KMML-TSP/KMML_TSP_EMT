WORKFLOW:

- The Current users created are admin, manager, staff, intern
- All users are stored in same Table separated by role column.
- Admin is already created & logged in.
- Password Encryption must be done.
- After Admin Home page created, Admin will create other user's accounts by assigning an user_id, name, role, email given manually by user.
- Password is empty for now.
- User can signup with admin given userid & email, then the password is mailed to the user, it can be later changed.

1. Remove select user & replace it with email (in Signup Page), since user role is fixed no need to select that.
2. Add password input column in signup page.
3. Admin Page
4. Encrypt Password
